					<h2>What is user experience?</h2>
					<p>User experience (UX) can be defined as the overall experience you have when using or interacting with something. That “something” could literally be almost anything, but in this context it refers to the experience the user has in contact with ABB software. This includes issues such as:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Is the product easy to use?</li>
						<li>Is it efficient in helping me in solving my task?</li>
						<li>Does it behave as expected?</li>
						<li>Is the look and behavior consistent throughout the application?</li>
						<li>Does the user interface look professional and trustworthy?</li>
						<li>Is it delightful to interact with?</li>
					</ul>
					<h3>Three reasons to focus on user experience</h3>
					<ol>
					 	<li>Improve efficiency and reliability in use</li>
					 	<li>Avoid user errors</li>
					 	<li>Desirable products increase sales</li>
					 </ol>

					<h2>A style guide vs. great user experience</h2>
					<figure class="module full">

					<p class="support strong">The illustration is based on Stefan Klocek’s <a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2012/09/fixing-broken-user-experience/">“Hierarchy of effort to fix a broken user experience”</a>	
					</p>					
					<p>This style guide aims to lay the foundation for visual simplification and consistency across ABB’s software portfolio. It also includes UI patterns and examples that can be reused. However, using a style guide does not guarantee great user experiences, or even consistent user experiences.</p>
					<p>This style guide will help ABB advance up the two first levels in the UX maturity hierarchy, but to reach higher levels we as a company need a wider collaborative effort. In order to consistently and over time deliver great software that satisfies our customers, there must be a commitment to user-centered product design and UX research in all phases of product development. This includes thorough user insight into what really makes a difference for the safety or productivity of our end users, iterative product development and validating assumptions through end-user testing.</p>

					<h2>ABB software interfaces</h2>
					<img class="spaced2" src="../content/0custom/ux2.svg" alt="">					
					<p>ABB software is used on a wide variety of hardware formats and within different environments (control room, field, office, home). In addition, a variety of input devices, such as keyboard, mouse, touch screens, trackpads and embedded buttons are used.</p>
					<p>The user interface must be adapted to format and context. This style guide intends to support product teams in delivering consisten and recognizable user experiences across all ABB software interfaces.</p>
