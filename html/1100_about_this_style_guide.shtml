				<h1>About this style guide</h1>
				<section>
					<div class="module">
						<p>This document describes the ABB look &amp; feel for software products. Many of our customers and end-users see ABB primarily through the day-to-day interactions with the software products we deliver. Providing professional, modern and harmonized user interfaces is a basic requirement in today’s market.</p>
						
						<h3>Companion material</h3>
						<p>The elements in this style guide will also be provided through companion material:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Adobe Illustrator components file for quick mock-up creation</li>
							<li>Icon library in several formats</li>
							<li>Font file</li>
							<li>Style sheets</li>
						</ul>					
						<h3>About version 1.0 Managed release</h3>
						<p>The style guide will be ready for widespread adoption by the end of 2016. During 2016 the style will be applied to pilot products from all ABB divisions, and learnings from these pilots will improve the style guide along the way.</p>					
						<p>If you plan on updating or developing UIs in 2016 and want to know how to use this style guide, please contact the Common UX team.</p>

						<h3>Disclaimers</h3>
						<h4>The style guide does not yet cover:</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>A complete set of standard controls and components</li>
							<li>Touch optimized components</li>
							<li>Complete set of color palettes</li>

						<h4>Different screen sizes and hardware formats:</h4>
						<p>This release of the style guide does not specify at pixel level all elements necessary for all types of hardware formats, screen sizes and use contexts. It includes the main graphical concept and provides some basic components and examples of use. Where measurements are presented, they are based on typical desktop screen resolutions. In future versions of this style guide, the measurements will be adapted to all types of screens by using device independent units (such as em).</p>

					<h2>Using this style guide</h2>
					<figure class="module full">
						<img src="../content/0custom/Design_process.svg" alt="" width="1100">
					</figure>
					<p>This model illustrates how the style guide and Common UX team mainly act as a resource in the later steps of a design process, when visual design is applied. All conceptual design decisions must be made within the product team. This includes content, functionality and interaction models, layout and navigation.</p>
					<p>It is highly recommended that product teams include professional designers, either internal or contracted, to ensure a user-centered design process.</p>

					<h2>Criteria for using this style guide</h2>
					<div class="intro">
						<p>There exists several style guides within ABB already, and it might not always be entirely clear when to follow which style guide. Use these criteria to decide whether this style guide is appropriate for your case. </p>
					</div>
					<article>
						<h3 class="spaced1">Use this style guide if one or more of the following applies:</h3>
						<p class="do">your product is sold to customers or your product is bundled together with products (HW or SW) that are sold to customers</p>
						<p class="do">your product is used to deliver services to a customer, including engineering of systems and products</p>
						<p class="do">your product is typically used by customers in their daily work</p>
						<p class="do">you product presents data from your customer’s plant or equipment </p>						
					</article>
					<article>
						<h3 class="spaced1">Do not use this style guide if:</h3>
						<p class="dont">the primary function of your product is related to sales or marketing</p>
						<p class="dont">the product is primarily used to communicate with customers</p>

					<h2>Hierarchy of style guides</h2>
					<article class="colGroup split23 wide">
						<div>
							<h3>ABB UI style guide</h3>
							<p>This style guide is intended to be an overarching, top-level guide valid for all SW products in all divisions in ABB. It is intended to provide the basic level of harmonization and familiarity between ABB products.</p>
						</div>
						<figure>
							<img src="../content/About__StyleGuide_frontpage.png" alt="">
						</figure>
					</article>
					<article>
						<h3>Product or BU-level style guides (optional)</h3>
						<p>Some BUs and products might choose to develop a more detailed style guide to create a closer alignment with less variability between products or screens, within the boundaries set by the ABB UI style guide. Typically this can specify further a limited set of layout options, narrow down the choice of colors used and specify interaction patterns.</p>
					</article>
					<article class="colGroup split23 wide">
						<div>
							<h3>Product specifications</h3>
							<p>Typically, the handover from interaction designers to the product developers will still be the detailed, screen by screen specifications necessary to develop the product. By applying the style guides above the specification process will be more efficient as much will already be defined above, and similar from product to product.</p>
