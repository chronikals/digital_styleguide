						<p>Purposeful, well-designed animations bring an interface to life and make the experience feel
                            crafted and polished. Animated transitions can help users understand and later recall how
                            the interface works and how the components fit together. Nothing feels more unnatural than
                            a sudden change.

						<h3>Animated transitions</h3>
						<p>A transition occurs when an element changes from one state to another, with a sequence
                            of in-between frames. It has a beginning and an end state, and can have more in-between
                            states. Changes in an object’s speed and direction draw the users’ attention. Asymmetric
                            acceleration and deceleration creates a more natural and delightful motion.
                        </p>
						<p>In some cases, animated transitions can also make an interface feel more responsive, even
                            when the transition takes the same amount of time. Care must be taken to avoid animated
                            transitions to slow down an application.
                        </p>

						<h3>Smooth and responsive</h3>
						<p>ABB aims to deliver professional software,
                            where transitions and animations should
                            only be used to support user interaction
                            and system flow. They should not be used
                            as a gimmick or for decorative purposes.
                        </p>
						<p>Transitions and animations should not
                            be disturbing or annoying, but rather
                            contribute to the overall experience of a
                            smooth, reliable and responsive system.
