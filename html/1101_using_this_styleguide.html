                        This model illustrates how the style guide and Common UX team mainly act as a resource in the later steps of a design
                        process, when visual design is applied. All conceptual design decisions must be made within the product team. This includes
                        content, functionality and interaction models, layout and navigation.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It is highly recommended that product teams include professional designers,either internal or contracted, to ensure a
                        user-centered design process.

                            There exists several style guides within ABB already, and it might not always be entirely clear when to
                            follow which style guide. Use these criteria to decide whether this style guide is appropriate for your case.
