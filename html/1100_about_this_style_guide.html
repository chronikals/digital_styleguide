                        <p>This document describes the ABB look & feel for software products. Many of our customers
                            and end-users see ABB primarily through the day-to-day interactions with the software
                            products we deliver. Providing professional, modern and harmonized user interfaces is a
                            basic requirement in today’s market.
                        </p>
                        <p>This style guide is valid for all types of software from all divisions and business units
                            within ABB. The primary target applications are those that are either sold to customers
                            or delivered to customers as part of service agreements. Other applications, such as
                            engineering tools or internal tools are also free to follow this style guide.
                        </p>
                        <p>This style guide has been produced by the Common UX project, a part of ABB’s cross-division
                            SW2020 initiative. For more information, please visit </p>

                    <p>This model illustrates how the style guide and Common UX team mainly act as a resource in the later steps of a design
                        process, when visual design is applied. All conceptual design decisions must be made within the product team. This includes
                        content, functionality and interaction models, layout and navigation.
                    </p>
                    <p>It is highly recommended that product teams include professional designers,either internal or contracted, to ensure a
                        user-centered design process.

                            follow which style guide. Use these criteria to decide whether this style guide is appropriate for your case.</p>

                                ABB. It is intended to provide the basic level of harmonization and familiarity between ABB products.

                        <p>Some BUs and products might choose to develop a more detailed style guide to create a closer alignment
                            with less variability between products or screens, within the boundaries set by the ABB UI style guide. Typically
                            this can specify further a limited set of layout options, narrow down the choice of colors used and specify
                            interaction patterns.

                                screen specifications necessary to develop the product. By applying the style guides above the specification
                                process will be more efficient as much will already be defined above, and similar from product to product.
