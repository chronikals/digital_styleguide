                        <p>This document describes the ABB look &amp; feel for software products. Many of our customers and
                            end-users see ABB primarily through the day-to-day interactions with the software products we
                            deliver. Providing professional, modern and harmonized user interfaces is a basic requirement in
                            today’s market.</p>
                        <p>This style guide is valid for all types of software from all divisions and business units
                            within ABB. The primary target applications are those that are either sold to customers
                            or delivered to customers as part of service agreements. Other applications, such as
                            engineering tools or internal tools are also free to follow this style guide.</p>

                        <h3>Companion material</h3>
                        <p>The elements in this style guide will also be provided through companion material:</p>
                        <ul>

                        </ul>
                        <p>This style guide has been produced by the Common UX project, a part of ABB’s cross-division
                            SW2020 initiative. For more information, please visit </p>

                        <h4>The style guide does not yet cover:</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>A complete set of standard controls and components</li>
                            <li>Touch optimized components</li>
                            <li>Complete set of color palettes</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4>Different screen sizes and hardware formats:</h4>
                        <p>This release of the style guide does not specify at pixel level all elements necessary for all
                            types of hardware formats, screen sizes and use contexts. It includes the main graphical concept
                            and provides some basic components and examples of use. Where measurements are presented, they
                            are based on typical desktop screen resolutions. In future versions of this style guide, the
                            measurements will be adapted to all types of screens by using device independent units (such as
                            em).</p>

                    <p>This model illustrates how the style guide and Common UX team mainly act as a resource in the later
                        steps of a design process, when visual design is applied. All conceptual design decisions must be
                        made within the product team. This includes content, functionality and interaction models, layout
                        and navigation.</p>
                    <p>It is highly recommended that product teams include professional designers, either internal or
                        contracted, to ensure a user-centered design process.</p>

                        <p>There exists several style guides within ABB already, and it might not always be entirely clear
                            when to follow which style guide. Use these criteria to decide whether this style guide is
                            appropriate for your case. </p>

                        <p>Some BUs and products might choose to develop a more detailed style guide to create a closer
                            alignment with less variability between products or screens, within the boundaries set by the
                            ABB UI style guide. Typically this can specify further a limited set of layout options, narrow
                            down the choice of colors used and specify interaction patterns.</p>

                                the style guides above the specification process will be more efficient as much will already
